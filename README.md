#### Bugs that need to be fixed: 
* Plan on using React Redux to keep results on page when refreshed
* Searches are asynchronous and one search behind need to correct problem
* Spotify new releases feature is only active for an hour at a time due to spotify's API Token only valid for 1 hour. Plan on putting info into a database as a work around
